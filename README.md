# BirdClicker
Bird Clicker app: Inspired from the Cow Clicker app the social game on Facebook by **Ian Bogost**.

The application have a picture of a bird with the bird name, title and number of clicks, all displayed when clicking on one of the list item which is actually a small version of the same displayed image generated using **Gulp**, the number of clicks increment whenever we click on the displayed image.

The solution is responsive since I have adopted the **Flexbox** approach. 

**Version 1 with jQuery**

**Version 2 with vanillaJS**

**Version 3 with knockoutJS**

**Version 3 with backboneJS**

The difference between these four versions is the way we implements the functionalities of the app. In the first version, with jQuery we are not using any kind of libraries just a pure jQuery functions. In the other versions, we are writing more professional, clean and stable code using organizational techniques.
